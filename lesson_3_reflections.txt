When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Fill in your answer here

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

others work on the same branch online - i do not necessarily want this to be on my computer

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

fork is github term for cloning a repository on github - clone is a copy a repository - branch is version of repository


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

one can see and control what other changes other collaborators made to the code

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

using google docs - hard to keep track of different branches, but all the changes are online immidiately. but impossible to keep track of forks (no link back)

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

it is easier to make different versions of the same code
